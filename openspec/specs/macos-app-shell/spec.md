# macos-app-shell Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change macos-foundation. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Native app shell owns workspace structure
The system SHALL provide a native macOS application shell that owns OpenMUX workspaces, windows, tabs, pane stacks, local pane tabs, and focus relationships independently of the terminal engine, even when each visible pane region hosts a real libghostty-backed terminal surface.

#### Scenario: Workspace structure is modeled in app-level terms
- **WHEN** a developer creates or manipulates workspace structure
- **THEN** the system represents that structure using OpenMUX-native concepts rather than raw terminal-engine objects

#### Scenario: Frequent shell updates preserve focused pane continuity
- **WHEN** the app shell applies frequent non-structural workspace updates
- **THEN** OpenMUX preserves focused-pane continuity without resetting first-responder ownership away from the active pane

### Requirement: Terminal hosting uses AppKit-first integration
The system SHALL host terminal surfaces within an AppKit-first application shell, with SwiftUI limited to non-terminal chrome where it does not control terminal interaction semantics, and with real pane surfaces embedded as native AppKit-hosted views. Sidebar terminal navigation SHALL restore native focus to the selected hosted terminal surface.

#### Scenario: Terminal surfaces stay in native view ownership
- **WHEN** a terminal pane is displayed in the desktop application
- **THEN** the terminal surface is hosted within an AppKit-owned interaction model that preserves native focus, menus, event routing, and accessibility expectations

#### Scenario: Sidebar terminal click restores terminal focus
- **WHEN** the user clicks a sidebar terminal metadata row
- **THEN** the selected hosted terminal pane becomes the active first-responder target after the workspace shell refreshes

### Requirement: App shell responsibilities remain separate from terminal rendering
The system SHALL keep shell responsibilities such as window lifecycle, pane layout, pane-stack chrome, focus management, notifications, and workspace orchestration separate from terminal rendering and PTY behavior, even when the shell hosts real libghostty-backed surfaces.

#### Scenario: Shell concerns do not require terminal-engine knowledge
- **WHEN** shell-level logic handles layout or focus behavior
- **THEN** that logic operates without requiring direct knowledge of terminal-engine internals

### Requirement: The native shell SHALL minimize non-terminal chrome
The native macOS shell SHALL prioritize pane space over decorative chrome by removing low-value persistent header UI and reducing nested card-like container treatment around terminal content. Pane-local headers MAY remain where needed for pane-tab navigation and pane context.

#### Scenario: Shell does not reserve a top header row
- **WHEN** a workspace window is shown
- **THEN** the main content region does not include the current persistent top header bar and that vertical space is available to pane content

#### Scenario: Pane content is not wrapped in stacked cards
- **WHEN** a terminal pane stack is rendered
- **THEN** the shell avoids multiple nested rounded bordered containers around the pane and keeps the pane header as the primary remaining pane-local chrome

### Requirement: The native shell SHALL support a collapsible workspace column
The native macOS shell SHALL allow the workspace navigation column to be shown or hidden at runtime without changing workspace model data, SHALL persist that visibility state across app restarts as OpenMUX-owned UI state, and SHALL expand the pane content area when the column is hidden.

#### Scenario: Hiding the workspace column expands pane space
- **WHEN** the user triggers the workspace-column toggle while a workspace window is focused
- **THEN** the workspace column collapses and the main pane region expands to use the reclaimed width

#### Scenario: Showing the workspace column restores navigation UI
- **WHEN** the user triggers the workspace-column toggle again
- **THEN** the workspace column becomes visible again without recreating the workspace model

#### Scenario: Sidebar visibility survives restart
- **WHEN** the user closes OpenMUX after hiding or showing the workspace column and later launches OpenMUX again
- **THEN** the workspace column visibility matches the last remembered OpenMUX UI state

### Requirement: The native shell SHALL visually integrate the titlebar with the shell
The native macOS shell SHALL use AppKit window configuration so the titlebar/background region visually blends with the shell instead of appearing as a separate contrasting strip above the workspace content.

#### Scenario: Window chrome reads as one shell surface
- **WHEN** a workspace window is displayed with the current theme
- **THEN** the titlebar region visually matches or blends with the shell background rather than presenting a separate default macOS band

### Requirement: Transparent titlebar preserves native double-click zoom
Workspace windows SHALL preserve native macOS double-click titlebar zoom/maximize behavior while using the transparent full-size-content titlebar appearance.

#### Scenario: Titlebar double-click requests window zoom
- **WHEN** the user double-clicks the workspace window titlebar or unified titlebar background region
- **THEN** OpenMUX invokes the native window zoom behavior for that window

#### Scenario: Titlebar appearance remains integrated
- **WHEN** a workspace window is displayed
- **THEN** the titlebar region remains visually integrated with the shell background

### Requirement: The native shell surfaces terminal action outcomes without surrendering shell ownership
The native macOS shell SHALL consume supported terminal action events and apply the resulting user-visible behavior through OpenMUX-owned shell state, pane chrome, and native host integrations rather than delegating shell ownership to the terminal engine.

#### Scenario: Pane title updates stay shell-owned
- **WHEN** OpenMUX receives a supported title-change terminal event for a pane
- **THEN** the native shell updates the corresponding pane or tab label through OpenMUX-owned shell state rather than letting the terminal engine own shell chrome directly

#### Scenario: Native host side effects stay shell-owned
- **WHEN** OpenMUX receives a supported terminal event requesting URL opening, a desktop notification, or bell behavior
- **THEN** the native shell performs the host-side behavior through macOS-native integrations while preserving OpenMUX ownership of workspace and pane structure

### Requirement: The native shell surfaces pane status from supported terminal events
The native macOS shell SHALL surface pane-local status for supported terminal events including progress, child-exited state, and renderer health so the user can understand terminal state from OpenMUX chrome.

#### Scenario: Pane shows terminal progress state
- **WHEN** OpenMUX receives a supported progress-report terminal event for a pane
- **THEN** the shell updates pane-owned status or chrome for that pane without requiring Ghostty-owned app UI

#### Scenario: Pane shows session-ended or unhealthy state
- **WHEN** OpenMUX receives a supported child-exited or renderer-health terminal event for a pane
- **THEN** the shell updates pane-owned status to reflect the ended or unhealthy session state

### Requirement: Native menus SHALL reflect effective keybindings
The native macOS shell SHALL derive representable menu key equivalents from the effective OpenMUX keybinding registry.

#### Scenario: Default menu shortcuts are shown
- **WHEN** OpenMUX starts without user keybinding overrides
- **THEN** native menu items show the documented default shortcuts

#### Scenario: Rebound menu shortcut is shown
- **WHEN** a user configures a supported representable chord for an action with a native menu item
- **THEN** that menu item shows the configured chord

#### Scenario: Unbound menu shortcut is cleared
- **WHEN** a user configures an action's default chord as `"none"` and no replacement chord is configured
- **THEN** the corresponding menu item does not show the unbound shortcut

### Requirement: Menu and terminal interception SHALL stay coherent
The native macOS shell SHALL keep menu key equivalents and terminal-pane shortcut classification synchronized with the same effective keybinding registry.

#### Scenario: Menu shortcut triggers same action as terminal shortcut
- **WHEN** a chord is displayed on a native menu item and the focused pane receives the same chord
- **THEN** both paths resolve to the same OpenMUX shell action

#### Scenario: Keybinding reload updates menus
- **WHEN** configuration reload changes effective keybindings
- **THEN** native menu key equivalents update without restarting existing terminal sessions

### Requirement: Native shell SHALL route inline pane-tab controls through shared pane-stack actions
The native macOS shell SHALL implement inline pane-tab add and close controls as AppKit-owned shell chrome that calls the existing shared pane-stack actions without involving terminal-engine internals.

#### Scenario: Inline controls preserve the terminal bridge boundary
- **WHEN** the user creates or closes a pane-local tab through inline pane-tab chrome
- **THEN** the native shell routes the action through OpenMUX workspace/controller operations without requiring `libghostty` types outside the terminal bridge

#### Scenario: Inline controls do not alter terminal keyboard ownership
- **WHEN** inline pane-tab controls are added to pane chrome
- **THEN** terminal keyboard input, IME composition, Option/right-Option input, and unrelated terminal pointer regions remain terminal-owned

### Requirement: Native shell SHALL provide scoped structural shortcuts
The native macOS shell SHALL expose scoped structural shortcuts for pane tabs, pane splitting/removal, and workspace create/delete actions while preserving existing shortcuts.

#### Scenario: Pane remove shortcut is available
- **WHEN** the user invokes `Cmd+Shift+W`
- **THEN** the shell removes the active pane using the existing pane remove action

#### Scenario: Workspace close shortcut is available
- **WHEN** the user invokes `Cmd+Shift+N`
- **THEN** the shell closes/deletes the active workspace using the existing workspace delete action

#### Scenario: Existing structural shortcuts remain available
- **WHEN** the user invokes existing structural shortcuts such as `Cmd+D`, `Cmd+Shift+D`, `Cmd+T`, `Cmd+W`, or `Cmd+N`
- **THEN** the shell preserves their existing behavior

#### Scenario: Legacy Backspace pane remove shortcut is not available
- **WHEN** the user invokes `Cmd+Shift+Backspace`
- **THEN** the shell does not claim that chord as a pane-remove shortcut

#### Scenario: No duplicate pane-add shortcut is introduced
- **WHEN** the user invokes `Cmd+Shift+T`
- **THEN** the shell does not claim that chord as a pane-add shortcut

### Requirement: App menus SHALL separate workspace, pane, and view responsibilities
The native macOS shell SHALL organize menu actions by OpenMUX-native responsibility so model actions are discoverable without crowding the View menu.

#### Scenario: Workspace actions live in Workspace menu
- **WHEN** the app builds its main menu
- **THEN** workspace lifecycle, workspace movement, previous-workspace, and direct workspace jump actions appear under a Workspace menu

#### Scenario: Pane actions live in Pane menu
- **WHEN** the app builds its main menu
- **THEN** split, remove-pane, pane-tab, and pane navigation actions appear under a Pane menu

#### Scenario: View menu remains for chrome visibility
- **WHEN** the app builds its main menu
- **THEN** the View menu contains visual shell/chrome controls such as toggling the workspace column rather than workspace or pane model actions

#### Scenario: Menu split preserves shortcuts
- **WHEN** keybindings are applied or rebound
- **THEN** the moved menu items keep shortcuts from the shared keybinding registry

### Requirement: Native menus SHALL include plugin-contributed items
The native macOS shell SHALL include valid plugin-contributed menu items in deterministic locations while preserving existing OpenMUX-owned menu organization and keybinding behavior.

#### Scenario: Plugin contributes Configuration menu items
- **WHEN** an installed plugin declares valid Configuration menu contributions
- **THEN** the app shell displays those items in the Configuration menu or equivalent config-focused menu section

#### Scenario: Plugin menu item is invoked
- **WHEN** the user selects a plugin-contributed native menu item
- **THEN** OpenMUX invokes the declared typed target without routing through terminal input

#### Scenario: Menus refresh after plugin changes
- **WHEN** plugin installation, uninstall, or config reload changes available plugin contributions
- **THEN** the native menus refresh without restarting terminal sessions

### Requirement: Plugin menu items SHALL preserve terminal focus behavior
Invoking plugin-contributed menu items SHALL NOT send menu command text to the focused terminal or disturb terminal keyboard semantics beyond normal focus changes for opened panes.

#### Scenario: Menu item opens settings pane
- **WHEN** a terminal pane is focused and the user selects a plugin menu item that opens a settings pane
- **THEN** no command text is typed into the terminal and the new pane follows normal extension-pane focus behavior

#### Scenario: Menu item reloads config
- **WHEN** a terminal pane is focused and the user selects a plugin menu item that reloads config
- **THEN** the terminal session remains alive and its input encoding behavior is unchanged

### Requirement: Native shell SHALL render adapter-reported pane status consistently
The native macOS shell SHALL render pane status reported by adapters through the same pane chrome, tab strip, and sidebar status surfaces used for terminal-native progress events.

#### Scenario: Adapter working status shows active orb
- **WHEN** an adapter reports `working` status for a pane
- **THEN** the native shell shows the same active progress affordance used for terminal-native working progress

#### Scenario: Adapter needs-input status shows attention orb
- **WHEN** an adapter reports `needs-input` status for a pane
- **THEN** the native shell shows an attention affordance that remains associated with that pane until status changes or idle-clear policy removes it

#### Scenario: Adapter status does not shift tab identity
- **WHEN** the native shell renders an adapter-reported status orb in a sidebar terminal row or pane tab
- **THEN** the status affordance does not reduce the space reserved for pane title and subtitle identity when existing leading gutter space is available

### Requirement: Adapter status SHALL preserve terminal-first interaction
Rendering adapter-reported status SHALL NOT alter terminal focus, keyboard routing, mouse routing, or text input dispatch.

#### Scenario: Status update does not steal focus
- **WHEN** an adapter reports a new pane status while the user is typing in any terminal pane
- **THEN** OpenMUX updates shell chrome without changing the focused pane or moving keyboard focus

#### Scenario: Status rendering is not an input handler
- **WHEN** a pane has adapter-reported status
- **THEN** the status rendering does not intercept IME composition, dead keys, Option/right-Option input, paste, or terminal mouse reporting
